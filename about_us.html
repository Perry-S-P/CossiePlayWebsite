            	<h1>Wondering who we are?</h1>
                <p>CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. Our passion for cosplay has led us to create outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers and customers of fancy dress can order any kind of costume - from a simple Spiderman outfit, a wild Elf or even costumes featuring some more advanced and exciting features such as; armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and work force-fields(!). Of course we also do cosplay based on game characters, we can almost anything!</p>
                <p>We are also proud to host the monthly "CossiePlay Party" at the town hall, so make sure you check it out!</p>
            <p> But who is who at CossiePlay? Well our family includes:</p> <p><h4>Steven Rogers</h4> – Steve was a Navy Seal for 37 years before getting interested in hosting parties and helping people enjoy their fantasies together in a family-friendly fun environment.</p>

            <p><h4>Sally Rogers</h4> – After only 6 weeks of her first dress-making course, Sally was already designing and sewing elaborate ball gowns and costumes that amazed her instructors. 10 years later and she's making even more amazing creations for happy customers.</p>
