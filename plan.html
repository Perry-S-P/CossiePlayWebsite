<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Scott Perry<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC425531</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>To increase the public knowledge on cosplay and specifically the company and website of CossiePlay by creating a modern website that is filled with up-to-date information and provides ease of access for new and veteran customers.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>Evaluating our success will be based on reviewing sales over three months since the publishing of the website, compare to data from the previous years. A spike in orders and attendence to social events hosted by CossiePlay will be considered a success.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Our target audience is the existing customer base with the aim of targeting the new generation who may not not have previous knowledge of the company CossiePlay or of Cosplay itself.</p>
